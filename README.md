# FieldtypeLeafletMapMarker Module for ProcessWire

This is a port of the Map Marker Fieldtype by Ryan Cramer. Instead of Google maps it uses Leaflet maps.

Google maps geocoding is still used for geocoding default lat/lng values under *field* settings but the geocoding on page
editing uses Per Liedmans [leaflet-control-geocoder] (https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-control-geocoder)

This Fieldtype for ProcessWire holds an address or location name, and automatically geocodes the address to latitude/longitude using leaflet-control-geocoder. The resulting values may be used to populate any kind of map (whether Leaflet Maps or another).

Support for per-marker customisation of visuals and popup content is included.

## Installation

1. Copy all of the files for this module into /site/modules/FieldtypeLeafletMapMarker/

2. In your admin, go to the Modules screen and "check for new modules." Under the 'Fieldtype' section, install the 'Leaflet Map Marker' module (FieldtypeLeadletMapMarker)

3. Under the 'Inputfield' section, install the 'Leaflet Map Marker' module (InputfieldLeafletMapMarker) if it is not
   already installed.

4. Under the 'Markup' section, install the 'Leaflet Map' module (MarkupLeafletMap) **and** the 'Inline Scripts' module (MarkupAddInlineScript)

5. In your admin, go to Setup > Fields > Add New Field. Choose LeafletMapMarker as the type.
   If you are not sure what to name your field, simply "map" is a good one! Once created, configure the settings on the *input* tab.

6. Add your new "map" field to one or more templates, as you would any other field.


### How to use from the page editor

1. Create or edit a page using one of the templates you added the "map" field to.

2. Type in a location or address into the "address" box for the map field. Then click
   outside of the address, and the Javascript geocoder should automatically populate the
   latitude, longitude and map location. The Leaflet geocoder will accept full addresses
   or known location names. For instance, you could type in "Disney Land" and it knows
   how to find locations like that.

3. The geocoding also works in reverse. You may drag the map marker wherever you want
   and it will populate the address field for you. You may also populate the latitude,
   longitude and zoom fields manually if you like. Unchecking the box between address
   and latitude disables the geocoder.

_If the geocoding does not work, please ensure that your browser is not blocking the execution of any scripts._


### How to use from the API, in your template files

In your template files, you can utilize this data for your own Leaflet Maps (or anything else that you might need latitude/longitude for).

Lets assume that your field is called 'map'. Here is how you would access the components of it from the API:
```````````
echo $page->map->address;	// outputs the address you entered
echo $page->map->lat; 		// outputs the latitude
echo $page->map->lng; 		// outputs the longitude
echo $page->map->zoom;		// outputs the zoom level
`````````

## Markup Leaflet Map

This package also comes with a markup helper module called MarkupLeafletMap. It provides a simple means of outputting a Leaflet Map based on the data managed by FieldtypeLeafletMapMarker.

### Basic Usage

Seeing as we are going to need access to the module as we generate the HTML header block (to add script and style
includes), we first load and gain access to the Markup module...
```
<?php $map = wire('modules')->get('MarkupLeafletMap'); ?>
```

_Leaflet's js code requires jquery - so make sure you load that in HTML header section, the markup module will not do this for you._

MarkupLeafletMap includes the _getLeafletMapHeaderLines()_ method that generates all the needed script and style includes for your HTML header
section so simply add this somewhere before your closing `</head>` tag:
```
<?php echo $map->getLeafletMapHeaderLines(); ?>
```

If you already load FontAwesome elsewhere in your header and you do not want it included as part of the Leaflet Map header lines, use the following version:
```
<?php echo $map->getLeafletMapHeaderLines(false); ?>
```


In the location within the body of your HTML where you want your map to appear, place the following:
`````````
<?php echo $map->render($page, 'YOUR MARKER FIELD'); ?>
`````````

To render a map with multiple markers on it, specify a PageArray rather than a single $page:
`````````
$items = $pages->find("A SELECTOR THAT GETS YOUR PAGES WITH MARKER FIELDS");
echo $map->render($items, 'YOUR MARKER FIELD');
`````````

To specify options, provide a 3rd argument with an options array:
`````````
echo $map->render($items, 'YOUR MARKER FIELD', array('height' => '500px'));
`````````

### Options

Consult the following table for more options for customising your Leaflet map.

Option | Notes
------ | -----
`width` | Width of the map (type: string; default: 100%)
`height` | Height of the map (type: string; default: 300px)
`zoom` | Zoom level 1-25 (type: integer; default: from your field settings)
`id` | Map ID attribute (type: string; default: mgmap)
`class` | Map class attribute (type: string; default: MarkupLeafletMap)
`lat` | Map center latitude (type: string/float; default: from your field settings)
`lng` | Map center longitude (type: string/float; default: from your field settings)
`useStyles` | Whether to populate inline styles to the map div for width/height (type: boolean; default: true). Set to false only if you will style the map div yourself
`useMarkerSettings` | Makes single-marker map use marker settings rather than map settings (type: boolean; default: true)
`markerLinkField` | Page field to use for the marker link, or blank to not link (type: string; default: url)
`markerTitleField` | Page field to use for the marker title, or blank not to use a marker title (type: string; default: title)
`fitToMarkers` | When multiple markers are present, set map to automatically adjust to fit to the given markers (type: boolean; default: true)
`popupFormatter` | A PHP callback function, taking a `$page` as an argument, for generating additional content of a marker's popup box
`markerIcon` | The default name of the FontAwesome icon to use in the marker - without the prefix 'fa-'. (type: string; default: 'home')
`markerIconColour` | The default colour the of the FontAwesome icon (type: string; default 'white')
`markerColour` | The default colour of the marker body that surrounds the icon. (type: string; default 'darkblue'.) See Leaflet.AwesomeMarker's [markerColor](https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers#properties) entry for the available colours - they are limited.
`markerFormatter` | A PHP callback function (taking a PW `$page` and AwesomeMarker `$marker_options` as arguments) for customising the look of any marker on the map. This is called once for each marker being placed on the map and allows the defaults to be overridden for each marker.

## Customising A Marker's Visuals and Popup Contents

[Leaflet.AwesomeMarkers](https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers) and [FontAwesome](http://http://fontawesome.io/) are included in the module's assets and allow you to customise the look
of your markers very nicely.

### Changing the Default Marker Appearance

You can change the default appearance of your map markers by supplying values for any or all of the `markerIcon`,
`markerIconColour` and `markerColour` options that you pass into the `$map->render()` method. For instance, to make all
the markers Red, with a white flag icon, use this code...
```
<?php
$options = array('markerIcon' => 'flag', 'markerColour' => 'red');
echo $map->render($items, 'YOUR MARKER FIELD', $options);
?>
```

### Changing Per-Marker Appearance

As part of the options array, you can specify a callback that can override the values used to generate each marker's
appearance. The callback function takes a PW `$page` and some `$marker_options` as arguments and can use any fields from
the page to customise the visuals for the marker generated for that page.

If you are using a PHP5.4 or above, anonymous functions make this very easy. If you are stuck with an older version of
PHP, you can use a named function or method.

To support this, let's add a new field called 'marker_icon', of type text, to the template of the pages that hold the LeafletMapMarker
field.

```
<?php
$options = array(
    'markerFormatter' => function($page, $marker_options) {
        $marker_options['icon'] = $page->marker_icon; // Override the default icon for this marker.
        return $marker_options;
    }
);
echo $map->render($items, 'YOUR MARKER FIELD', $options);
?>
```
`$marker_options` is the array of [Leaflet.AwesomeMarker properties](https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers#properties) that will be used to generate this marker.

In this way, you can let the pages holding your LeafletMarkers also define their visuals.

### Customising Popup Content

You can similarly use a callback method to customise the content that appears within a marker's popup box. The return
value from this method should be an HTML snippet that will be placed into the popup box _by Javascript_.

```
<?php
$options = array(
    'popupFormatter' => function($page) {
        $out[] = "<strong>Contact: $page->phone_number</strong>";
        $out[] = "<img src=\"{$page->image->url}\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" />"; // ** NB: Use escaped double quotes if HTML attributes needed **
        return implode('<br/>', $out);
    }
);

echo $map->render($items, 'YOUR MARKER FIELD', $options);
?>
```

_NB._ The example above uses a PW image field called 'image' that is configured as a single instance field.
